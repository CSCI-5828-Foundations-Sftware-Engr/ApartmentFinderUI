### What is your project all about? What are you trying to achieve?

The website is a user-friendly, comprehensive online platform designed to simplify and streamline the apartment hunting experience for those looking to rent in the beautiful city of Boulder, Colorado. Our goal is to provide prospective tenants with a hassle-free, personalized experience to find the perfect apartment that matches their unique preferences and requirements.
The project also aims to let the user book and manage appointments. Also, it will let the users write reviews of properties and these reviews will them be processed through sentiment analysis library and stored into the database with the analysis. The analysis will be used to rate the properties. 

### Objectives:

```
- Create an intuitive, easy-to-navigate website that offers a seamless user experience.
- Consolidate a wide range of available apartment listings in Boulder, ensuring up-to-date and accurate information.
- Implement advanced search filters and sorting options to allow users to refine their search based on their preferences, including budget, location, property size, amenities, pet-friendliness, and more.
- Incorporate a reliable rating and review system that encourages users to provide honest feedback on their rental experiences, fostering trust and transparency within the community.
- Implement responsive design principles to ensure the website is compatible with a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

What design decisions have you made?
	1	Navigation: Create an intuitive navigation menu that allows users to easily explore different sections of the website. 
	              Include essential items such as Home, Search, About Us, Resources, and Contact Us. 
								Implement a fixed header or sticky navigation menu to keep the main navigation easily accessible as users scroll 
								through the site.
	2	Responsive Design: Ensure that the website is fully responsive, automatically adjusting its layout and design to fit 
	                     different devices and screen sizes. This will provide a seamless user experience across desktops, 
											 laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
	3	User Interface (UI) Elements: Design consistent and recognizable UI elements, such as buttons, input fields, checkboxes, and sliders, 
	                                that are easy to interact with and visually appealing.
	4	Loading Speed: Optimize the website's performance to reduce loading times, which can be achieved by compressing images, 
	                 using browser caching, and minimizing the use of JavaScript and CSS files.

What processes are you using to coordinate your team?

	1. We are using agile methodology for our project for flexible and iterative project.
	2. JIRA is used as a project management software to create stories and all other 		    tasks and assign to team members.
	3. We are using a slack channel, to communicate for updates, questions and 			    information sharing.
	4. Leveraging MongoDB as our database for store various data.
	5. GitHub is the version control tool being used.
	6. Setting deadlines to complete tasks leaves good time at the end to focus on 		     updating things.
	
How is work distributed across the team? Who is doing what for each iteration?
	  There are 2 divisions for all the iterations, one for backend and one for frontend.
    The stories are created and assigned equally to all the members with both front and backend.

    Initially:
    Backend: Rithik, Shreyas
    Frontend: Ishika, Evan and Lakshmi

    In the future the work is distributed in such a way that everyone gets a chance to work on everything and get hands on experience.
    The tasks that each of us worked on are on the JIRA board.
