## Testing in the project

The code for integration tests and unit tests have been written in our project. We have used Mocha and Chai frameworks to do our testing. In the test folder, we can find 5 files that have 16 test cases written in them.


Additionally, we have used @testing-library/react to create testing for our UI!

Moreover, we have integrated these tests in our Continuous Integration pipeline as well. So whenever we raise a PR, these tests are run and only after all the test cases pass, we can merge the branch into the main branch. 

To run the tests locally, just run "npm test" and then the npm package manager will do it's magic. 


The current status of our tests are they they pass! This can be seen in our Github repo throught the green checkmarks on the commit history.

For front end, we still have to write some more test cases to to increase our coverage to 100%

| Acceptance tests                            | For acceptance tests, we have not used any framework but have tested all of our endpoints and use cases manually after deploying on Heroku. As discussed with the TAs, manual testing was acceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
