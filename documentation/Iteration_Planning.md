The document contains the velocity of our development team for each iteration of the Apartments Search project. Velocity is a metric used in Agile development methodologies to measure the amount of work completed by a team during a specific iteration or sprint.

we analyzed the stories and tasks we have identified for our project, using their story points to estimate the number of iterations required for completion. The total story points for our project is 100 (based on the sum of all story points for each feature/task).

Based on the assumed initial velocity of 25 story points per iteration, we can predict the number of iterations needed for the project:

Total Story Points / Velocity per Iteration = Number of Iterations 100 / 25 = 4 Iterations

Thus, we estimate that the project will take approximately 4 iterations to complete, this is only an initial estimation and could change as we learn more about our team's actual velocity and make adjustments for unexpected challenges or changes in project scope.

Subsequent Iterations and Velocity Adjustments

As we progress through the project, we will continue to update this Iteration Planning page to document our team's velocity and make predictions for future iterations. We will adjust our velocity estimates based on actual team performance, as well as any changes in project scope or team capacity. This will help ensure that our project planning remains realistic and aligned with the team's capabilities.

After each iteration, we will update the velocity documentation as follows:

Document the actual story points completed during the iteration. Calculate the team's average velocity for the previous iterations. Adjust the velocity for future iterations based on the calculated average and any changes in project scope or team capacity. Update the iteration prediction using the adjusted velocity. By continually updating our Iteration Planning documentation, we will improve our ability to plan and execute the project effectively.
